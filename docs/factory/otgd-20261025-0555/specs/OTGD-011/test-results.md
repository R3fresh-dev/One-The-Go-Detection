# OTGD-011: verification results

Canonical: `openspec/changes/canonical-operator-governance/specs/operator-authority/spec.md`; SHA-256 `a7bb7170b6fc7c119e8e93eae9783767876a8f861a71588027577172c30a80e2`.
Planning snapshot HEAD: `33901a1ff785cd28e351d935be510d184fb7f8e2`; baseline implementation: `0844868aa543af4ab75ac5065ad48cf807b86bb3`.

Owner: `/root/verification`; OpenAI `gpt-6.1-sol/high` requested in PM dispatch; effective model identifier not independently exposed inside this worker. Scope: verification planning and static source inspection only. Relevant acknowledged decisions: D-001 v1 through D-004 v1. Execution candidate is not frozen.

Result: **NOT_RUN**. 9 individually identified requirements and 18 canonical acceptance cases are planned in `test-plan.md`. No current-source runtime suite, browser, native, firmware, live-dependency or performance result is claimed by this document. No historical evidence is transferred.

| Evidence class | Actual activity / outcome | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Planning inspection | Read canonical requirements/scenarios and shared contracts; indexed existing test symbols, CI gates and workflow commands. Source hashes appear in test-plan.md and shared report. This is not a passing acceptance test. | EXECUTED inspection only |
| Related automated checks | Commands and named assertions planned; no execution authorized in this assignment. Exit code, execution timestamp and artifact hash therefore absent. | NOT_RUN |
| Complete criterion coverage | Every case requires full acceptance assertions; related symbol matching is not proof of complete coverage. No-match cases are explicitly identified in the plan. | NOT_RUN |
| Browser/native/firmware/real dependencies/performance | Scope-specific prerequisites and commands in plan/shared report; no substitution from unit mocks or historical CI. | NOT_RUN |
| Physical/scientific/release qualification | No actual participant/device/study/assay/deployment/store evidence adopted; external approvals remain separate. | BLOCKED where applicable |

## Current case results

All stable case IDs in test-plan.md are NOT_RUN, except explicitly external-only cases which are BLOCKED on named acceptance evidence. On execution replace this aggregate with one result row per affected case, retaining command/procedure, environment, UTC time, observed outcome, exit code, evidence path/hash and exact candidate/test bindings. Do not turn expected THEN statements into observed results.

No completion, engineering/product signoff or council PASS follows from this planning record.
